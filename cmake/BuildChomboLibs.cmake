# Drives the vendored Chombo build (chombo/lib/GNUmakefile) from CMake.
#
# Chombo has no CMake build of its own; it ships a large, self-contained GNU
# make system that also runs the ChomboFortran preprocessor (perl) over the
# .ChF sources.  Rather than reimplement that, we invoke it -- but with every
# configuration variable passed on the `make` command line, where it overrides
# anything in a makefile.  That keeps the source tree free of the generated
# mk/Make.defs.local that the old in-tree build used to copy into place, so two
# builds with different settings can share one checkout.
#
# Two quirks of Chombo's makefiles are worth knowing:
#
#   * Dependency generation is written for csh (`CSHELLCMD`), which is not
#     installed by default on modern Linux or macOS.  The command it runs is a
#     plain pipeline, so /bin/sh executes it identically.
#   * Everything under lib/ (generated *_F.H headers, lib/include, the archives)
#     is shared between dimensions.  The 2D and 3D builds must therefore be
#     serialized, and each one's output snapshotted before the next runs.
