# vcell-chombo

The Chombo finite volume solver used by the [Virtual Cell](https://github.com/virtualcell/vcell)
framework: an embedded-boundary, adaptive-mesh PDE solver for reaction-diffusion
on curved geometry. It builds two executables from one source tree,
`VCellChombo2D_x64` and `VCellChombo3D_x64`, which VCell launches as a
subprocess against a `.fvinput` file.

This repository was split out of
[virtualcell/vcell-solvers](https://github.com/virtualcell/vcell-solvers), where
the solver had stopped being built (see [Provenance](#provenance)).

## Layout

| path | what |
| --- | --- |
| `VCellChombo/` | the solver: input parsing, VCell's variable/structure model, the Chombo scheduler, HDF5 output |
| `chombo/` | vendored [Chombo 3.x](https://commons.lbl.gov/display/chombo) with VCell's local fixes |
| `vcell-expressionparser/` | submodule — evaluates the user's rate laws, initial conditions and geometry expressions |
| `vcell-messaging/` | submodule — progress messaging to VCell's server over the JMS REST bridge |
| `cmake/` | the Chombo build driver and `GetGitRevisionDescription` |
| `tests/` | ctest smoke coverage |

## Build

CMake-driven; Conan 2.x supplies HDF5, zlib, libzip and (with messaging on)
libcurl, plus `cmake`/`ninja` as `tool_requires`.

### Prerequisites

- **GCC with gfortran.** Chombo is roughly half Fortran, and gfortran's runtime
  is built against libstdc++, so the whole link has to be a libstdc++ world.
  That is why `conan-profiles/CI-CD/Linux-AMD64_profile.txt` pins GCC rather
  than the Clang/libc++/mold toolchain the other VCell solver repos use.
- **GNU make and perl**, for the vendored Chombo build (see
  [How Chombo gets built](#how-chombo-gets-built)).
- The two submodules. A plain `git clone` leaves them empty and CMake stops at
  configure time:

  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

### Canonical build

```bash
CC=gcc CXX=g++ FC=gfortran conan install . --build=missing \
      -pr:a=conan-profiles/CI-CD/Linux-AMD64_profile.txt
source build/generators/conanbuild.sh
CC=gcc CXX=g++ FC=gfortran cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$PWD/build/generators/conan_toolchain.cmake" \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DOPTION_TARGET_MESSAGING=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

Expect the first build to spend several minutes in Chombo — it compiles ~300
sources twice, once per dimension. `source build/generators/conanbuild.sh`
matters: it puts Conan's `cmake`/`ninja` on `PATH`, and the `ninja>=1.12.1` floor
is above what Ubuntu 24.04 ships.

Where the generator files land is decided by `layout()` in `conanfile.py`. It
flattens the tree to `build/` + `build/generators/` only when
`tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:generator=Ninja` is set in the active profile;
without it `cmake_layout()` inserts the build type and you get
`build/Release/generators/` instead.

### Options

| option | default | effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPTION_TARGET_CHOMBO2D_SOLVER` | `ON` | build `VCellChombo2D_x64` |
| `OPTION_TARGET_CHOMBO3D_SOLVER` | `ON` | build `VCellChombo3D_x64` |
| `OPTION_TARGET_MESSAGING` | `OFF` | link libcurl and report progress to VCell's server; without it `vcell-messaging` still builds, but the curl path is replaced by `NullCurlProxy` |
| `OPTION_TARGET_PARALLEL` | `OFF` | MPI build. Carried over from the in-tree version and **not currently exercised** — configure warns |
| `CHOMBO_BUILD_JOBS` | `nproc` | parallelism for the Chombo GNU make step |
| `OPTION_EXTRA_CONFIG_INFO` | `OFF` | dump every CMake variable at the end of configure |

Turning off a dimension halves the build time, which is worth it while
iterating: `-DOPTION_TARGET_CHOMBO3D_SOLVER=OFF`.

## How Chombo gets built

Chombo ships a large, self-contained GNU make system that also runs the
ChomboFortran preprocessor (perl) over its `.ChF` sources. Reimplementing that in
CMake would mean reimplementing ChomboFortran, so `cmake/BuildChomboLibs.cmake`
drives Chombo's own `make lib` instead — but passes every configuration variable
(`DIM`, `OPT`, `FC`, `HDFINCFLAGS`, …) on the command line, where make gives it
precedence over anything in a makefile. Nothing is written into `chombo/lib/mk`,
so one checkout can serve several build trees.

Two details are worth knowing before you touch it:

- Chombo bakes its configuration into each archive's name
  (`libboxtools2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.OPT.a`). Predicting that string in CMake
  is what made the old in-tree build so fragile. `cmake/CollectChomboLibs.cmake`
  globs for the archives after the fact and copies them to stable paths under
  `build/chombo/<dim>d/lib/`.
- Everything under `chombo/lib` is shared between dimensions, including the
  generated `*_F.H` headers and `lib/include`, and those *are* dimension
  dependent. The 2D and 3D builds are therefore serialized, and each one's
  headers are snapshotted to `build/chombo/<dim>d/include/` before the next runs.

`chombo/lib` picks up build products in place. They are gitignored; `make
realclean` in that directory (or deleting `*.a`, `include/`, `src/*/{o,d,f,p}`
and the generated `*_F.H`) resets it.

## Tests

`ctest --test-dir build` runs, per dimension:

- `VCellChombo<N>D_x64_usage` — the solver prints its usage and exits non-zero
  when given no input file.
- `VCellChombo<N>D_x64_smoke` — runs `tests/resources/smoke<N>d.fvinput` end to
  end and checks that the `.log`, `.mesh.hdf5` and `.hdf5.zip` VCell expects were
  written, and that the archive holds the `.sim.hdf5` files the log names.

The smoke inputs are hand-written (VCell normally generates `.fvinput` files) and
deliberately minimal: a disc/sphere of `cyt` inside a box of `ec`, one volume PDE
initialised to 1.0 with no flux across the membrane and no reaction, so the
solution stays 1.0. That covers the whole pipeline — implicit-function geometry,
EB mesh generation, the semi-implicit solve, HDF5 output, zip archiving — but it
is **not** a numerical regression suite. Nothing here compares against baseline
values; those baselines live with VCell's own integration tests.

## Provenance

VCellChombo had not been compiled in years. Its `CMakeLists.txt` guarded
everything on `OPTION_TARGET_CHOMBO_SOLVER`, a variable no caller ever set, and
listed sources that had been deleted when messaging was centralized; every CI
recipe in vcell-solvers passes `-DOPTION_TARGET_CHOMBO{2,3}D_SOLVER=OFF`. Getting
it building again needed changes on both sides of the split:

**Chombo** — four classes of code modern compilers reject: default arguments on
friend declarations (`ProblemDomain`, `IntVectSet`, `DisjointBoxLayout`), an
`istream`-to-`bool` conversion, comparison functors that are not const-invocable
(C++17 tightened `std::map`), and the BSD `HUGE` constant glibc no longer
defines. Two build-system fixes as well: `mk/reverse` was a csh script (csh is
not installed by default on modern Linux or macOS), and GCC's `-dumpversion` has
printed only the major number since GCC 7, which left Chombo's minor-version
tests failing with "unexpected operator".

**VCellChombo** — `SimTool` called `zip32()`/`unzip32()`, which no longer exist
anywhere in vcell-solvers (the FV solver moved to libzip years ago); they are now
a small libzip wrapper. The `vcell-messaging` API has since been rewritten
(`JobEvent::Status`, `setWorkerEvent` overloads instead of `new WorkerEvent`,
lazy singleton with `cleanupInstanceVar`), and the JMS REST bridge no longer
needs the queue/topic/password fields the input file still carries.

**vcell-expressionparser** — `ASTFloatNode::infixString` formatted every float as
the literal string `":.20g"`, so any `infix()` round-trip failed to re-parse.
Chombo hits this on every `newImplicitFunction()` call, i.e. on every geometry.
